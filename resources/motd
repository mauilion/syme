Run `tmux` to start a shared session or `tmux attach` to join.

The tmux escape character is control-z, so you can use `C-z d` to detach.

Use the `add-github-user` script to add a public key to this session.

When you are done with this node, run `sudo halt` but make sure you've
pushed all your work as it will be gone when the node halts.
